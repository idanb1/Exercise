Red Hat Python 3 HW script:

1 - get an array of input ASCII files
2 - search for lines containing a match to a RE pattern (given on the command line as well as the files dirs+name).
3 - print file name and the line number for every match.
4 - multiple matches (in a sequence) is allowed (without overlapping matches)
5 - PEP8
6 - Build 5 tests with pytest
7 - Use module to parse parameters from CLI
8 - Use 're' module for matching the pattern
9 - 




Process explaination:

At the very first steps of this task I've not heard about argParse module, so I created one by myself;
The first struggle for me was to make 2 parameters mutually exclusive, then I googled a bit and found argParse docs.
My solution using argParse from the main runner function, but I also included ParameterParser (the module I created) to show you my whole way for the solution.
I think the next struggle was to learn more deeply about Docker because I didn't experienced with this area before.
